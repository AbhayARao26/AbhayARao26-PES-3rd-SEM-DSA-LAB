/*
 Counting Leaves in a Binary Tree 1
 
 You are given a binary tree represented by its level order traversal with the special value -1 indicating the absence of a node. Your task is to write a C program to count the number of leaf nodes in the binary tree using a recursive approach.

 A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. A leaf node is a node that does not have any children.

 Input Format:
    The input consists of two parts: The size of the level order traversal (an integer). The level order traversal of the binary tree as a sequence of integers separated by spaces. The sequence will contain the special value -1 where a node is absent.

 Constraints:
    NONE

 Output Format:
    Output the number of leaf nodes in the binary tree.

 Sample Input:
    7
    1 2 3 4 5 -1 -1
 
Sample Output:
    3
